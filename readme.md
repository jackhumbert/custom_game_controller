# Custom Game Controller

This is a mod for Cyberpunk 2077 that enables raw joystick/game controller input and configuration. Multiple devices (like two joysticks) can be used at the same time. For examples of configurations, [check out the redscript folder](https://github.com/jackhumbert/custom_game_controller/tree/main/src/redscript/custom_game_controller). Below is a some of the documentation for `ICustomGameController`:

```swift
ï»¿public abstract native class ICustomGameController extends IScriptable {
  public native let pid: Uint16;
  public native let vid: Uint16;
  public native let id: Int32;
  public native let buttons: array<Bool>;
  // This is the enum used by `switches` interally:
  //   Center    = 0
  //   Up        = 1
  //   UpRight   = 2
  //   Right     = 3
  //   DownRight = 4
  //   Down      = 5
  //   DownLeft  = 6
  //   Left      = 7
  //   UpLeft    = 8
  public native let switches: array<Uint32>;
  public native let axes: array<Float>;
 
  public native let buttonKeys: array<EInputKey>;
  public native let axisKeys: array<EInputKey>;
  public native let axisInversions: array<Bool>;
  public native let axisCenters: array<Float>;
  public native let axisDeadzones: array<Float>;

  // Maps a controller button to a key
  //   button: 0-indexed
  //   key: https://nativedb.red4ext.com/EInputKey
  public native func SetButton(button: Int32, key: EInputKey);

  // Maps a controller axis to a key
  //   axis: 0-indexed
  //   key: https://nativedb.red4ext.com/EInputKey
  //   inverted: whether or not the axis should be inverted
  //   center: value between 0.0-1.0 that acts as the natural position of the axis
  //   deadzone: value between 0.0-1.0 that acts as a threshold for movement
  public native func SetAxis(axis: Int32, key: EInputKey, inverted: Bool, center: Float, deadzone: Float);

  // Called after the controller is created but not intialized (no values are read yet)
  // Use this to call SetButton & SetAxis
  public abstract func OnSetup() -> Void;

  // Called after new values are read, but before they're assigned
  public abstract func OnUpdate() -> Void;

  // Called when axis values are read from the controller, after center & deadzone correction
  //   index: 0-indexed axis index
  //   value: axis value to be compared & assigned if different
  public abstract func GetAxisValue(index: Uint32, value: Float) -> Float;
}
```

## Installation

[Get the latest release here](https://github.com/jackhumbert/custom_game_controller/releases) - `packed-v*.zip` in the release contains all of the requirements listed below at their most up-to-date versions (at the time of release). Simply extract it and copy the contents in your game's installation folder.

If you want to install the mod outside of a release (not recommended), the `build/` folder in the repo contains all of the mod-specific files that you can drag into your game's installation folder.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through redscript classes. Some examples are provided.

## Requirements

* [RED4ext](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext)
* [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript)
* [Input Loader](https://github.com/jackhumbert/cyberpunk2077-input-loader)

## Bugs

If you come across something that doesn't work quite right, or interferes with another mod, [search for or create an issue!](https://github.com/jackhumbert/custom_game_controller/issues) I have a lot of things on a private TODO list still, but can start to move things to Github issues.

## Development

These are some of the steps I take to update the mod for new versions of the game - it involves some manual address looking-up using IDA, a custom version of Zoltan, and my fork of RED4ext.SDK:

1. Merge deps/red4ext.sdk from upstream
1. Update all addresses with "1.62 RVA:" (that matches latest game version) in RED4ext.SDK
  1. Patterns & hints for each addresss should be in each file
  1. Addresses that don't have the current version likely aren't used
1. Run "Generate Addresses" in the VS Code project
1. Update IPad & XPad VFT addresses in src/red4ext/Main.cpp
