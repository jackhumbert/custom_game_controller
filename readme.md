# Custom Game Controller

This is a mod for Cyberpunk 2077 that enables raw joystick/game controller input and configuration. Multiple devices (like two joysticks) can be used at the same time. Installation of this mod disables Xbox controllers, but this will be an option (being able to use both together) in the future.

## Installation

[Get the latest release here](https://github.com/jackhumbert/custom_game_controller/releases) - `packed-v*.zip` in the release contains all of the requirements listed below at their most up-to-date versions (at the time of release). Simply extract it and copy the contents in your game's installation folder.

If you want to install the mod outside of a release (not recommended), the `build/` folder in the repo contains all of the mod-specific files that you can drag into your game's installation folder.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through redscript classes. Some examples are provided.

## Requirements

* [RED4ext](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext)
* [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript)

## Bugs

If you come across something that doesn't work quite right, or interferes with another mod, [search for or create an issue!](https://github.com/jackhumbert/custom_game_controller/issues) I have a lot of things on a private TODO list still, but can start to move things to Github issues.
